This is my second React project, but the first one that was functionally heavy. Learned a lot about how to use and manipulate different React elements and components. Started learning programming a month ago, so there was definitely a steep learning curve, but it was exciting to see the progress I made with each step. One of the biggest challenges was figuring out how to efficiently update the game state and re-render the board after each move. I also had to learn how to incorporate animations into the game, which was a new and interesting experience.
